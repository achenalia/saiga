Saiga transforms your new tab page into a personal study companion. Built with TypeScript and React, this interactive extension replaces the default new tab experience with a search engine selector designed to keep you focused on what matters mostâ€”your learning. Whether you're researching a topic or diving into your studies, Saiga empowers you to stay on track with an intuitive, learning-first interface tailored to your needs, adapting further as new features are added.


## Current Features

- **Search Engine Selector**: Choose your preferred search engine right from the new tab page. Easily switch between Google, Wikipedia, Khan Academy, or Youtube to find the information you need quickly and efficiently.
  
- **Interactive Background**: Engage with a dynamic, fidget-toy-like background featuring moving polygons that you can play with. This interactive element adds a touch of fun to your learning environment, helping to reduce stress and keep your mind active.
