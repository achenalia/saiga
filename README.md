Saiga transforms your new tab page into a personal study companion. Built with TypeScript and React, this interactive extension replaces the default new tab experience with a search engine selector designed to keep you focused on what matters mostâ€”your learning. Whether you're researching a topic or diving into your studies, Saiga empowers you to stay on track with an intuitive, learning-first interface tailored to your needs, adapting further as new features are added.
